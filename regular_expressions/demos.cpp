     *  This chapter introduces the library for regular expressions. That library allows you to use wildcards
        and patterns to search and replace characters in strings.

        In principle, you can do the following with regular expressions:
        • Match the whole input against a regular expression
        • Search for patterns that match a regular expression
        • Tokenize a character according to a token separator specified as a regular expression
        • Replace in the first or all subsequences that match a regular expression
